    It happens! 🤷‍♀️
    
    There are a number of reasons why this might happen.
    
    It could be that the program was poorly run by your predecessor.
    
    They could have chosen a tech partner that wasn’t right for your company.
    
    Maybe employees weren’t clued up on what was in it for them!
    
    Well, if you’re looking to give it another go…
    
    Because you KNOW what’s possible with an employee advocacy program and you’re determined to get those results?!
    
    LOVE. IT. 👏
    
    And you’re in luck!
    
    Here at DSMN8, we’ve been helping launch and run hundreds of employee advocacy programs since 2016, so we have a few tricks up our sleeves!
    
    We’ve learned a thing or two about the reasons why an employee advocacy program can go stale, and we’ve put together a guide to getting things up and running a second time.
