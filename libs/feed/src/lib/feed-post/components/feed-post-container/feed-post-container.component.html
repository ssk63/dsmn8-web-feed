      <p>Managing an employee advocacy program? Or about to launch one?</p>

      <p>Wanna know the secret to increasing user adoption?</p>

      <p>Champion 👏 the 👏 employee 👏 benefits 👏</p>

      <p>No doubt your employees are already managing a hefty tech stack.</p>

      <p>If you want to increase user adoption…</p>

      <p>
        You HAVE to let employees know why this isn’t just another tool they’re
        being asked to manage.
      </p>

      <p>For example:</p>

      <p>We all want to work on our personal brands online these days.</p>

      <p>The reason most of us don’t?</p>

      <p>We’re short on time ⏱</p>

      <p>
        An employee advocacy platform makes managing your OWN social media
        presence easier than ever.
      </p>

      <p>Communicate this with employees 💪</p>

      <p>Let them know how this new tool will benefit THEM.</p>

      <p>Then watch your adoption rates skyrocket 🚀</p>

      <p>
        There’s a reason why G2 users voted us the best employee advocacy
        platform for user adoption!
