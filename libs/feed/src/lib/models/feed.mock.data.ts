      'FAILED previously with employee advocacy?\n\nIt happens! 🤷‍♀️\n\nThere are a number of reasons why this might happen.\n\nIt could be that the program was poorly run by your predecessor.\n\nThey could have chosen a tech partner that wasn’t right for your company.\n\nMaybe employees weren’t clued up on what was in it for them! \n\nWell, if you’re looking to give it another go…\n\nBecause you KNOW what’s possible with an employee advocacy program and you’re determined to get those results?!\n\nLOVE. IT. 👏\n\nAnd you’re in luck!\n\nHere at DSMN8, we’ve been helping launch and run hundreds of employee advocacy programs since 2016, so we have a few tricks up our sleeves!\n\nWe’ve learned a thing or two about the reasons why an employee advocacy program can go stale, and we’ve put together a guide to getting things up and running a second time.\n\nCheck out the link in the comments to learn how to reboot and win with employee advocacy.\n\nLet’s get set up for success 🔗👇',
