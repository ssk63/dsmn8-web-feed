IT. 👏\n\nAnd you’re in luck!\n\nHere at DSMN8, we’ve been helping launch and run hundreds of employee advocacy programs since 2016, so we have a few tricks up our sleeves!\n\nWe’ve learned a thing or two about the reasons why an employee advocacy program can go stale, and we’ve put together a guide to getting things up and running a second time.\n\nCheck out the link in the comments to learn how to reboot and win with employee advocacy.\n\nLet’s get set up for success 🔗👇",
